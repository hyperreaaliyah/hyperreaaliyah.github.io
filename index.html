				<h2 class="aboutTitle">About</h2>

				<p>Fundamentally, HYPERREAALIYAH is a <i>simulation</i> of an artist. It functions as a conceptual totality through which artists who understand its premises can channel their works. As an art collective, the anonymity of HYPERREAALIYAH provides shelter for the participating artists. This is particularly necessary when creating artworks that use copyrighted material or deal with socially or politically sensitive issues. Artworks done in the name of HYPERREAALIYAH are the result of both individual and collective effort. Currently there are five artists who feed into HYPERREAALIYAH.</p>

				<p>HYPERREAALIYAH was conceived by artist and writer Jenna Jauhiainen in the fall of 2014 after months of research into the thinking of Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007). The name HYPERREAALIYAH is a combination of two words - <i>hyperreality</i> and <i>aaliyah</i>. Hyperreality for Baudrillard refers to a reality <i>more real than real</i>. As our visual culture experiences the ecstasy of images, it simultaneously sacrifices its relationship with the real. Aaliyah on the other hand is a Hebrew word for <i>ascent</i>, and refers to the return of diasporic Jews to the holy land of Israel. In our days when hyperreality has become an everyday phenomenon, we are all in diaspora from the so-called holy lands of meaning. The purpose of HYPERREAALIYAH is to reveal the real behind the hyperreal whilst questioning the current structures of meaning production. </p>

				<p>HYPERREAALIYAH poses no limitations when it comes to mediums, but at the moment we primarily work with digital material. We take images, videos and other material from the Internet as relics of hyperreality, and use them to create our art. This is a very sensitive process when it comes to copyright. What we argue is that the conceptual totalities we create are independent of the original copyrighted material – as artefacts of the Internet, they are as naturalized as mountains and meadows are as subjects of painting or photography. </p>
