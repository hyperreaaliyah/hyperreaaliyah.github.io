				<h2 class="aboutTitle">About</h2>

				<p>Fundamentally, HYPERREAALIYAH is a <i>simulation</i> of an artist. It functions as a conceptual totality through which artists who understand its premises can channel their works. As an art collective, the anonymity of HYPERREAALIYAH provides shelter for the participating artists. This is particularly necessary when creating artworks that use copyrighted material or deal with socially or politically sensitive issues. Artworks done in the name of HYPERREAALIYAH are the result of both individual and collective effort. Currently there are five artists who feed into HYPERREAALIYAH.</p>

				<p>HYPERREAALIYAH was conceived by artist and writer Jenna Jauhiainen in the fall of 2014 after months of research into the thinking of Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007). The name HYPERREAALIYAH is a combination of two words - <i>hyperreality</i> and <i>aaliyah</i>. Hyperreality for Baudrillard refers to a reality <i>more real than real</i>. As our visual culture experiences the ecstasy of images, it simultaneously sacrifices its relationship with the real. Aaliyah on the other hand is a Hebrew word for <i>ascent</i>, and refers to the return of diasporic Jews to the holy land of Israel. In our days when hyperreality has become an everyday phenomenon, we are all in diaspora from the so-called holy lands of meaning. The purpose of HYPERREAALIYAH is to reveal the real behind the hyperreal whilst questioning the current structures of meaning production. </p>

				<p>HYPERREAALIYAH poses no limitations when it comes to mediums, but at the moment we primarily work with digital material. We take images, videos and other material from the Internet as relics of hyperreality, and use them to create our art. This is a very sensitive process when it comes to copyright. What we argue is that the conceptual totalities we create are independent of the original copyrighted material – as artefacts of the Internet, they are as naturalized as mountains and meadows are as subjects of painting or photography. </p>

							<p>Yesterday we (sort of) celebrated the independence day of Finland. Many demonstrations were held in Helsinki. The most problematic of them was a march organized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Resistance_Movement">Nordic Resistance Movement</a>, a Swedish political party and a Neo-Nazi organization. In addition to Finnish members of the group, there were also Swedish Nazis who came to participate on the march. We decided to disturb their militaristic march over the Pitkäsilta bridge by walking next to them with a speaker blasting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeoMOnGn6Xo">'Den glider in'</a>, the victory song which the Swedes made in 1995 in anticipation of winning Finland in the finals of the Ice Hockey World Championship. Contrary to the glib expectations of the Swedes, 1995 became the first time Finland won the Championship and thus we took their song to celebrate our victory. MM95, as it is referred to in Finland, is an emotional soft spot of nationalistic pride for many Finns. By playing the song and singing it loud to the marching Nazis, we hoped to stir contradictory emotions in the Finns and Swedes who participated while implying that we have already won Sweden in the Blackberry Winter War of 1995. We have some audiovisual documentation of this action which might be released later.</p>

							<p>Max and Jenna trolled the Suomi Ensin! (Finland First!) demonstration against the Guggenheim Helsinki project. A curious object was created: a sign that read Нет! ("NO!" in Russian). The sign was totally kosher in the demonstration against Guggenheim Helsinki held on the Senate Square, but on the Market Square where the Finland First! group held its demonstration, it became an object non grata. The reason for this is the suspicion about Russian involvement in right wing activities in Finland. A video of this action (made by Finland First! activists on spot) can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsoyA_RUUHo">here</a>.</p>

							<p>Two nights ago, OPTIC ITALO party was held in a secret location in Helsinki. We were proud to celebrate the occasion by presenting a new video work, titled <a href="https://vimeo.com/193364995">HYPERTROPIC</a>. It is composed of associations we had of tropical matters, and as such it reveals the depths of our individual prejudices.</p>

							<p>A week ago, we took part to the Peli Poikki! demonstration against racism which attracted 15 000 participants to the center of Helsinki. We also went to various counterdemonstrations, including the Rajat Kiinni! (Close the Borders!) demonstration held in Narinkkatori. To our surprise, the openly racist group was sporting Pepe The Frog flag. We immediately felt the need to take Pepe back from the racists and show him a better party. Very quickly we managed to give the impression of being 'rajakki' ourselves, and got Susanna Kaukinen to give the flag to us. Photographic documentation of the demonstration and this spontaneous Free Pepe! action can be seen <a href="http://dyslexiaisokhere.com/tagged/freepepe">here</a> .  </p>

A new work was made - a mixtape and a video to go along with a dance performance (you know, rave). As soon as she's able to finish the last version of it, it will find its way online. </p>
