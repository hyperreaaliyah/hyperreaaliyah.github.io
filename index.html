                <p>HYPERREAALIYAH is a simulation of an artist founded in 2014. The name is a combination of two words - ‘hyperreality’ and ‘aaliyah’. Hyperreality is an effect of a kind of an “ecstasy of images” experienced as more real than the reality which produced them. Aaliyah, on the other hand, is a Hebrew word for ascent and refers to the return of diasporic Jews to the holy land of Israel. As hyperreality has become an everyday phenomenon, we are all in diaspora from meaning. HYPERREAALIYAH attempts to reveal the real behind the hyperreal whilst questioning various structures of meaning production.</p>

The hypotheses we’ve attempted to visualize with this work is that there is a doppelgänger in each of us, or at least the capacity to be someone else, to lose ourselves, to go crazy. Methodologically we’ve dwelled into hypnotic, chaotic and psychedelic imagery, complemented with more conceptual, dualistic bits and pieces of great acting. As often is with our video works, I AM THE END is not suitable for sensitive audiences.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday we (sort of) celebrated the independence day of Finland. Many demonstrations were held in Helsinki. The most problematic of them was a march organized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Resistance_Movement" target="_blank">Nordic Resistance Movement</a>, a Swedish political party and a Neo-Nazi organization. In addition to Finnish members of the group, there were also Swedish Nazis who came to participate on the march. We decided to disturb their militaristic march over the Pitkäsilta bridge by walking next to them with a speaker blasting 'Den glider in', the victory song which the Swedes made in 1995 in anticipation of winning Finland in the finals of the Ice Hockey World Championship. Contrary to the glib expectations of the Swedes, 1995 became the first time Finland won the Championship and thus we took their song to celebrate our victory. MM95, as it is referred to in Finland, is an emotional soft spot of nationalistic pride for many Finns. By playing the song and singing it loud to the marching Nazis, we hoped to stir contradictory emotions in the Finns and Swedes who participated while implying that we have already won Sweden in the Blackberry Winter War of 1995. We have some audiovisual documentation of this action which might be released later.</p>

                            <p>Max and Jenna trolled the Suomi Ensin! (Finland First!) demonstration against the Guggenheim Helsinki project. A curious object was created: a sign that read Нет! ("NO!" in Russian). The sign was totally kosher in the demonstration against Guggenheim Helsinki held on the Senate Square, but on the Market Square where the Finland First! group held its demonstration, it became an object non grata. The reason for this is the suspicion about Russian involvement in right wing activities in Finland.</p>

                            <p>A week ago, we took part in the Peli Poikki! demonstration against racism which attracted 15 000 participants to the center of Helsinki. We also went to various counterdemonstrations, including the Rajat Kiinni! (Close the Borders!) demonstration held in Narinkkatori. To our surprise, the openly racist group was sporting Pepe The Frog flag. We immediately felt the need to take Pepe back from the racists and show him a better party. Very quickly we managed to give the impression of being 'rajakki' ourselves, and got Susanna Kaukinen to give the flag to us. Photographic documentation of the demonstration and this spontaneous Free Pepe! action can be seen <a href="http://dyslexiaisokhere.com/tagged/freepepe" target="_blank">here</a> .  </p>
