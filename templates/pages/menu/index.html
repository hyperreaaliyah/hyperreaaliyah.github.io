  <p><i>HYPERREAALIYAH is a return more real than real to the holy land of meaning.</i></p>

  <p>Fundamentally, HYPERREAALIYAH is a simulation of an artist. We work on our projects collectively, yet the main motor and creative force of HYPERRAALIYAH is Jenna Jauhiainen, the mother of the project. The project was conceived in late 2014 after months of research into the writings of Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007). </p>

  <p>HYPERREAALIYAH is a combination of two words - <i>hyperreality</i> and <i>aaliyah</i>. Hyperreality is Jean's concept, and in short it refers to reality spinning itself to hyperreality, to things more real than real. Aaliyah is a hebrew word for <i>ascent</i>, and refers to the return of diasporic jews to the holy land of Israel. HYPERREAALIYAH is aaliyah more real than the trip one can make to the real lands of Israel. It's an ascent back to the holy lands of meaning often lost in the spin of the hyperreal. Our art is often in-your-face in the similar way hyperreality itself is so much entwined in all our visual experience. </p>

  <p>A key part of HYPERREAALIYAH's process is to take things from the internet as relics of hyperrealiaty, and make them our own. Thus there is a documentative element to the process even though the end result is often surreal. The essence of our visual style is not having made anything ourselves - even videos shot by us do not count, as it is documentation per se. We see no reason to respect copyrights as what we are creating is new. </p>

  <p>In addition to revealing the structures of hyperreality, this project uses the methods of it to advance human rights. Even though it might not appear so on the first glance, this is a humanitarian art project. </p>
