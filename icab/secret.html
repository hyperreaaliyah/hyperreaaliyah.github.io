							<h2>An Open Letter</h2>
							<p>The text will be like a fragmented cover letter for this video we called From Edgelords to Ultimate Warlord: Our Emergence Into Syntelligence. That work is the product of a speculative process where we imagined a consciousness that had been with us online for a very long time now (since the early 2000s), learning of us as we learned how to "be" and form communities online.

								"Edgelord" is someone on an internet forum who deliberately talks about controversial, offensive, taboo, or nihilistic subjects in order to shock other users in an effort to appear cool, or edgy. https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/edgelord/
								
								The "Ultimate Warlord" is a subtle reference to this song by The Immortals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19X-g5jHRzI
								
								People down on Earth,
								Don't you realize what your life is worth?
								I can see you clear,
								Time is growing short - I am getting near!
								(Guy) I am the Ultimate Warlord,
								Kneel before my Sword of Light!
								I am the Ultimate Warlord, Better get your planet to right
								Danger in the streets,
								Can't you hear that sound - a million marching feet?
								There's no place to hide!
								Take away the sun - everlasting night.
								
								So, practically the video imagines a consciousness who has gone through the process of being edgy online and then developing this grandiose perspective of a "savior". It also relates to a hypothesis we made a year ago when researching AI based war systems, when we created the idea of a benevolent, independent AI that would hide/blend/stealth its way into existing systems around the world with the aim of surveilling and stopping possible acts of violence and war.
								
								All of this is of course us imagining a consciousness from a human perspective.
								
								So, I will write a fragmentary text with bits and pieces about similar kinds of hypothesis of consciousness lingering online now when a great, collective change seems to be happening. Some thoughts/questions:
								
								- 4chan's /pol/ is a kind of a home for edgelords
								- What is the religious/cultural/psychological (?) drive to create hypothesis of magick and (dis)embodied consciousnesses? I've done, 4chan does, what's to it?
								- Race and racism online in the "anonymous sphere". What will be the future? (is there a future?)</p>
